## Currency exchange app using [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com)
- No API key needed.
- The API data only refreshes once every 24 hours. ([more info](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/docs/free))
  - The new data/response saved and used till the next API refreshing date/time.
- The historic rates generated from the saved data/jsons.
  - The date gap between the historic data depends on the app usage frequency.
